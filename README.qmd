# Physical cycling infrastructure and cycling use

This repository contains reproducible R code to examine how different types of **physical cycling infrastructure** are associated with city-level cycling use across European cities.

The analysis focuses on infrastructure composition, distinguishing between:

- Segregated tracks  
- Painted lanes  
- Off-road paths  
- Shared footways  

Cycling use is measured using the EU Quality of Life Survey (83 cities; ≈70,000 respondents). Infrastructure data are derived from OpenStreetMap and classified using the `osmactive` R package.

The main research question is:

> How are different types of physical cycling infrastructure associated with cycling mode share across cities?

## Repository structure

- `R/` — scripts for data extraction, infrastructure classification, and metric calculation  
- `paper.md` — rendered manuscript draft
